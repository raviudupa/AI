# Telegram AI Demo Bot - Code Explanation

This document explains the structure and functionality of the `telegram_ai _demo/main.py` script.

---

## 1. Purpose
This script creates a Telegram bot that:
- Answers user questions using an OpenAI LLM (like GPT-4o-mini).
- Searches the web for up-to-date information using the Tavily API.
- Provides the current date and time.
- Handles greetings in a friendly way.

---

## 2. Key Components and Flow

### A. Environment Setup
- Loads environment variables from a `.env` file (API keys, tokens, etc.) using `load_dotenv()`.
- Ensures sensitive info (like API keys) isn’t hardcoded.

### B. Importing Required Libraries
- **Telegram Bot:** For interacting with Telegram users.
- **LangChain/OpenAI:** For LLM-based responses.
- **Tavily Web Search:** For up-to-date web search.
- **Pydantic SecretStr:** For securely handling the Tavily API key.
- **JSON:** For formatting web search results.

### C. API Key and Token Handling
- Loads the Tavily API key and ensures it’s present.
- Wraps the key in a `SecretStr` for security.
- Initializes the Tavily search tool.

### D. Tool Functions
- **Tavily Search:**
  - Takes a user query, performs a web search, and returns results as a JSON string.
- **LLM Only:**
  - Uses the OpenAI LLM to answer questions without web search.
- **Current Date and Time:**
  - Returns the current date, time, or both, depending on the query.

### E. LangChain Agent and Tools
- Defines a set of tools the agent can use.
- The agent decides which tool to use based on the user’s question.

### F. Telegram Bot Handlers
- **Start Command:** Greets the user when they start the bot.
- **Message Handler:**
  - Responds to greetings with a friendly message.
  - For other messages, passes the text to the agent, which chooses the best tool to answer.

### G. Main Application Loop
- Sets up the Telegram bot, adds handlers, and starts polling for messages.
